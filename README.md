Dear scholar, welcome to this GitHub page for our Deep Learning project. This repository holds many valuable lines of code of our experiments.
We provide you with an overview of the most relevant code files and their descriptions:
* `model.py` holds the undefended and defended model classes.
* `HAR.py` is for training above models on HAR data.
* `FGSM_attack_pytorch.ipynb` is for the Fast Gradient Sign Method attack.
* `patch_attack_pytorch.ipynb` is for the Adversarial Patch attack.
* `evaluate_model.py` is for evaluating a pretrained model. This script is unused and comes from the author of the model. It was used as a reference to evaluate the model in both attack files.
